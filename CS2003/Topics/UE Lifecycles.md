# About

> Familiarise yourself with Usability Engineering Lifecycles and estimate how long a task would take you. In the exam, you should be able to describe the lifecycle and justify why you have selected a model and justify the duration.

> LO3: design and implement a usability engineering cycle for the development of a pre-defined product, service or application



# Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

- A systems methodology - looks at **whole** system
- **Holistic** (whole) not reductionist (as parts)
- Emphasis on **understanding the situation** and solving **complex problems**
- Used in the early stages of the design lifecycle
- **Used in systems analysis** which recognise the **more complex and fuzzy nature of organisational life** where a variety of goals are being pursued
- **Interpretive and subjective**) approach 
- **User centred** - places users at the core (values, believes and views e.g. a university 'system')
- **Only takes analyst up to design** - says nothing about implementation, or evaluation

### The Seven Stages of SSM

# Usability Engineering Lifecycle

- Designed as a usability test plan
- Integrated into software development project
- Iterative model including three phases: 
	1. **Requirement Analysis** - understand user issues, what tasks users need to do, set goals for usability study
	2. **Design, testing and development** - conceptual design, project standards, final design
	3. **Installation** - feedback from the users

# Star Lifecycle

- Developed by HCI professionals
- Emphasises that ordering of activities is inappropriate
- Evaluation centred and encourages iteration
- Applicable to both small and large projects

### Pros and cons of Star Lifecycle
##### Pros
1. Allows designers to match the process to their developing needs
2. Needs are hard to specify initially as evaluation directs progress, so Star's no-ordering makes it better
##### Cons
1. Difficult to control process
2. Procedural models (e.g. waterfall) allow developers and managers to get an overall view of the development effort to track progress, specify deliverables, allocate resources, and set targets
