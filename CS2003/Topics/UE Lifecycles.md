# About

> Familiarise yourself with Usability Engineering Lifecycles and estimate how long a task would take you. In the exam, you should be able to describe the lifecycle and justify why you have selected a model and justify the duration.

> LO3: design and implement a usability engineering cycle for the development of a pre-defined product, service or application



# Soft Systems Methodology

- A systems methodology - looks at **whole** system
- **Holistic** (whole) not reductionist (as parts)
- Emphasis on **understanding the situation** and solving **complex problems**
- Used in the early stages of the design lifecycle
- **Used in systems analysis** which recognise the **more complex and fuzzy nature of organisational life** where a variety of goals are being pursued
- **Interpretive and subjective**) approach 
- **User centred** - places users at the core (values, believes and views e.g. a university 'system')
- **Only takes analyst up to design** - says nothing about implementation, or evaluation

### The Seven Stages of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

# Usability Engineering Lifecycle

- Designed as a usability test plan
- Integrated into software development project


Iterative model including three phases: 
	1. **Requirement Analysis** - understand user issues, what tasks users need to do, set goals for usability study
	2. **Design, testing and development** - conceptual design, project standards, final design
	3. **Installation** - feedback from the users

# Participatory Design

- Brings **users** to the heart of the design process - they are involved with every stage of the design
- Came about due to other methods involving users at certain stages of the process only e.g. requirements gathering, evaluation, etc.
- Users are the experts - they have knowledge that the designers/developers do not
- Users take an active role in co-designing solutions for themselves
- Designing ***for*** them vs designing ***with*** them

 - Good for expert systems as the experts will be able to help





# Star Lifecycle

- Developed by HCI professionals
- Emphasises that **ordering of activities is inappropriate**
- Evaluation centred and **encourages iteration**
- Applicable to **both small and large projects**

### Pros and cons of Star Lifecycle
##### Pros
1. Flexible due to having no specific ordering
2. Allows designers to match the process to their developing needs
3. Needs are hard to specify initially as evaluation directs progress, so Star's no-ordering makes it better
##### Cons
1. Difficult to control process
2. Procedural models (e.g. waterfall) allow developers and managers to get an overall view of the development effort to track progress, specify deliverables, allocate resources, and set targets

# Questions


### For each of the following scenarios, identify which UCD methodology you might use and justify your choice:

1. Designing an educational game for 5-6 year olds
2. Improving the delivery of our health services
3. Designing a system to improve the manufacturing process for workers at Vauxhall's car production in Luton

Options: 
- Soft Systems Methodology - good for understanding a complex problem
- Participatory design - where a high level of user involvement is required
- Star Lifecycle - has evaluation at the heart and encourages iteration
