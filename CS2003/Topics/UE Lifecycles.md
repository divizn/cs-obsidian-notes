# About

> Familiarise yourself with Usability Engineering Lifecycles and estimate how long a task would take you. In the exam, you should be able to describe the lifecycle and justify why you have selected a model and justify the duration.

> LO3: design and implement a usability engineering cycle for the development of a pre-defined product, service or application


# The UE Lifecycle

- Designed as a usability test plan
- Integrated into software development project
- Iterative model including three phases: 
	1. **Requirement Analysis** - understand user issues, what tasks users need to do, set goals for usability study
	2. **Design, testing and development** - conceptual design, project standards, final design
	3. **Installation** - feedback from the users
