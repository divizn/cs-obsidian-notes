- 1 hour on questions 3 and 4
- 30 minutes on question 5. 


### Topics

1. Familiarise yourself with **Usability Engineering Principles** by Don Norman. You should be able to provide a good understanding of UE principles and how they are implemented, as you will need to show this in sketch form in the exam.
