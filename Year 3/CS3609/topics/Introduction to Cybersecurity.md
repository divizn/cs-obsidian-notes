- **Cybersecurity** concerns the protection of computers, networks, systems, programs and data from **unintended or unauthorised access, change or destruction**

# Key Considerations

1. The threat landscape: what do I need to protect?
2. How do we design in cyber security?
3. How do we implement cyber security?
4. What are the risks, impacts and controls?

# Why do we need Cybersecurity?

- Business continuity
- Competitive advantage
- Reputation (RBS)
- ROI
- Shareholder value
- Privacy (DPA, GDPR)
- Legal obligations
- Intellectual property
- Supply chain integrity

### Six principles of GDPR/DPA

- Data must be:
	1. Processed lawfully, fairly and transparently
	2. Collected only for specific legitimate purposes
	3. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
	4. Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
	5. Stored only as long as is necessary
	6. Ensure appropriate security


# The Threat Landscape

- The big picture of potential risks and dangers people may face online. It can include a range of cybersecurity risks that can harm individuals, organisations, or businesses

- Who?
	- Cyber criminalss
	- Foreign nationals and intelligence agencies
	- Hackers
	- Industrial competitors
	- Hackers
	- Hacktivists
	- Employees

- Common attacks
	- Phishing
	- Malware

# Key Issues for UK Cyber Security

- Cyberspace = new opportunities
	- The **GOOD**: ecommerce, wider outreach, more efficient processes, etc.
	- The **BAD**: criminals have a new arena to commit crimes
		- e.g. online banking fraud, hacking, stalking, identity theft, malware
- The **UGLY** facts:
	- **74%** of SMEs (small/medium size enterprises) and **90%** of larger organisations suffered cyberattacks (2019)
	- Average cost of cyber attack = **£1.46m-£3.14m** or **£75k-£311k** for SMEs
	- Cost of cyber attacks to the economy = **£27billion** (UK) and **$1trillion** (US)
	- **£860m+** investment by the UK Government in cyber security since 2011
	- Data breaches cost up to 4% of the turnover!



# Covering the Basics

## CIA and Standards

- **CIA (Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability** Model
	- Describes the three goals of information security
	- Guides policy development within organisations

- **ISO 27000 Family**
	- Set of international standards for information security in enterprises, including practical application guidelines
	- 40+ standards and growing

## Legal Frameworks

- **Communications Act 2003** - Regulates telecommunications companies and ISPs
- **Data Protection Act 2018** - Controls how personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government
	- Data must be kept safely and securely, used fairly and lawfully, not transferred outside the EU
- **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** - Describes the rights (EU) individuals have over their personal information processed by businesses
