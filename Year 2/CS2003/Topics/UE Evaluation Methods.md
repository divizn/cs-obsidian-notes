# About

> Familiarise yourself with Heuristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walkthrough. You should be able to describe each of these expert evaluation methods, compare and contrast them and know how to use them effectively. Know the pros and cons of each, this will help you.



# Evaluation

### What is evaluation?

Evaluation: a process through which information about the usability of a system is gathered in order to improve the system or to assess a completed interface.‚Äù

### Why evaluate?

- Understanding the problem
- Comparing designs
- Checking conformance to a standard
- Engineering towards a target

All centre on asking "how well will the design do its job"

### Why do ***usability*** evaluation

Need to consider how well will the design do the job 
For example:
- will the operator be able to handle emergency calls faster than before?
- is the ticket machine simple enough so that people can use it successfully their first time?
- if this command is used by mistake, how can the user escape from it?
- how many people who try to use the system will continue to use it?
- how will the system be adopted by the organisation - will it change organisational responsibilities? 

### 3 goals for evaluation

1. Assess systems' functionality
2. Assess effect of interface on user - how easy to learn, usability, matches user expectations
3. Identify specific problems with the system - contextual features, -ve features

### 4 key considerations for selecting evaluation approaches

To determine the type and form of evaluative study to carry out, what are the:
1. characteristics of users
2. types of activities users do
3. environment of study
4. nature of thing being evaluated


### 3 main forms of Usability Evaluation

#### Analytical testing
1. Expert review
	- based on expert's opinions
	- can be done at different stages of design
2. Abstract testing
	- Draw from existing data
	- e.g. cognitive analysis/GOMS/KLM
#### Empirical
3. User or usability testing
	- experimental or qualitative studies of use


### Expert review - 'quickfire' approaches

- Heuristic evaluation
	- several passes; 'scorecard' approach
	- assessment on conformance to 10 design 'rules'
- Consistency inspection
	- terminology, colour, layout, inputs, outputs
	- training materials and help systems
- Cognitive walkthrough
	- similar to software engineering 'code walkthrough', but stepping through user actions on the interface to simulate users doing the task (especially for frequent tasks)
- Formal usability inspection
	- adversarial courtroom style meeting with moderator
	- present and discuss weaknesses/strengths



# Heuristic Evaluation

- Experts independently evaluate the user interface
