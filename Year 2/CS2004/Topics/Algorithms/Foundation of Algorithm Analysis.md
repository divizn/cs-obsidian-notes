# Comparing algorithms

- You have algorithm **A** and **B**
	- Both achieve the same thing
	- Which one do you choose?
- How would you compare them?
	- Low level - code of A vs code of B
	- High level - algorithm A vs algorithm B
- What are the criteria?
	- They are compared in terms of:
		- Efficiency
		- Time it takes
		- Resources consumed


# Run Time

- The running time of an algorithm varies with the input and typically grows with the input size]
- An algorithm may run faster on certain data sets than others
- Hence it would have the following run times:
	- **Best case**
		- Not very informative
		- Might not happen very often
	- **Average case**
		- Take all inputs and calculate time for all inputs
		- Sum all calculated values and divide by total inputs
	- **Worst case**
		- Easier to analyse
		- Crucial to applications such as air traffic control, surgery, finance and other real time applications
