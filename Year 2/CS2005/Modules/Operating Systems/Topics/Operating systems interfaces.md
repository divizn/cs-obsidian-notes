# Command Interpreter (or CLI)

- Allows direct command entry (interactive unlike batch)
- Sometimes implemented in kernel, sometimes by systems program
- Sometimes multiple types implemented as **shells**
- Primarily fetches a command from user and executes it
- Sometimes commands built-in (`cd`), sometimes just names of programs (`ffmpeg`)
- Can use shell scripting to produce useful OS programs (**Batch Files** e.g. `.bat`)
- Examples of CLI:
	- Command prompt
	- Bash
	- ZSH
	- PowerShell

# Batch files

- Collection of CLI commands run together to do various tasks
- Examples include:
	- Script to run a program (e.g. a `.bat` script to run a certain program with certain arguments)
	- Script to run tasks at a certain time using stuff like Windows Task Scheduler


### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- User-friendly **desktop metaphor** interface
- Usually mouse, keyboard, and monitor used
- Icons represent files, programs, actions, etc. (e.g. folder icon to open file explorer)
- Various mouse buttons over objects in the interface cause various actions (provide information, options, execute function, open directory (folder))

- Most "modern" operating systems now include both CLI and GUI interfaces
	- Microsoft Windows is GUI with CLI "command" shell
	- Apple Mac OS is GUI interface with UNIX kernel underneath and shell available
	- Unix and Linux have CLI with optional GUI interfaces (using desktop environments like CDE, KDE, GNOME)
