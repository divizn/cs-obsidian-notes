# What is a protocol?

- Human protocols:
	- "What's the time?"
	- "I have a question"
	- Introductions
- Network protocols:
	- Machines rather than humans
	- All communication activity in internet is governed by protocols

- With protocols, a specific message is sent, and a specific action is taken (when messages received, or other events)
- Protocols define the format and order of messages sent and received on a network and the actions taken on message transmission, receipt
