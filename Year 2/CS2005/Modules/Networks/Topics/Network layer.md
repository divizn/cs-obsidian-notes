- Network layer protocol provides for **logical communication between hosts**
- The network layer can be decomposed into two interacting parts, the **data plane** and the **control plane**
- The **data plane** functions include per-router functions in the network layer that determine how a datagram arriving on one of a router's input links is forwards to one of that router's output link
