- An encryption algorithm consists of the following components: 
	- A set ***K*** of keys
	- A set ***M*** of messages
	- A set ***C*** of ciphertexts
	- An encrypting function **E : K -> (M -> C)**
		- for each $k \in K, E_{k}$ generates ciphertexts from messages
	- A decrypting function **D : K -> (C -> M)
		- for each $k \in K, D_{k}$ generates messages from ciphertexts
	- Both ***E*** and ***D*** for any $k$ should be efficiently computable functions
