- An encryption algorithm consists of the following components: 
	- A set ***K*** of keys
	- A set ***M*** of messages
	- A set ***C*** of ciphertexts
	- An encrypting function **E : K -> (M -> C)**
		- for each $k \in K, E_{k}$ generates ciphertexts from messages
	- A decrypting function **D : K -> (C -> M)
		- for each $k \in K, D_{k}$ generates messages from ciphertexts
	- Both ***E*** and ***D*** for any $k$ should be efficiently computable functions
- An encryption algorithm must provide the following **essential property**:
	- Given a ciphertext $c \in C,$ a computer can compute a plaintext $m$ such that $E_{k} (m) = c$ **ONLY IF** it processes the key $k$
- Then, a computer holding $k$ can decrypt ciphertexts to the plaintexts used to produce them ,but a computer not holding $k$ cannot decrypt these ciphertexts
- It's important to be **infeasible** to derive $k$ from the ciphertext ($c$ is exposed)

- There are two main types of encryption algorithms: **symmetric and asymmetric**
