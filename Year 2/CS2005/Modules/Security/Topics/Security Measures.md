# Security Measure Levels

- Impossible to have absolute security, but you can make cost to perpetrator sufficiently high to deter most intruders.
- Security is as weak as the weakest link in the chain (the weakest link is the first entry of an attack usually)

##### The four security levels:

1. **Physical** - Data centres, servers, connected terminals

2. **Human** - Avoid **social engineering, phishing, dumpster diving (looking at "trash" (e.g. stuff left on the internet) in an attempt to find information that could cause a security risk**

3. **Operating System** - Protection mechanisms, debugging

4. **Network** - Intercepted communication, interruption, DOS
